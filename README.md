# Introduction to Mapping using QGIS

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are an essential digital tool for the creation and analysis of maps and geographic data. QGIS is an open-source software that offers a powerful and adaptable platform to do GIS analysis.

This tutorial will guide you through the very basics of GIS mapping concepts. Then, we will use QGIS to project a map and do some basic analysis and drawing functions on it.
